# AStarSnake
This is my first exploration in trying to automate the game snake. 
In the folders you find the Snake file that's used to house a lot of the main classes, 
a world file that's used to house the gameplay and game states, and an A* file that's used to 
house a alot of the automation aspects of the snake. If you want to run the game itself, run the
World.py file. I have to be honest though, this isn't the most effecient way to write program and 
I'll probably push a lot of things in the future to fix the big-O. 

The gradient branch is where a lot of my test code in making a gradient calculation is going. 
If you check out the notes folder, you can see my thought process and notes on everything. 
I'm not really sure if this is a good way of doing it and I'm definitly second guessing myself on 
many decisions, but so far it's working out in my favor. Also, using a gradient to calculate "closeness"
of the snake in one region as opposed to another isn't a method I've learned how to do or even thought about
doing in the past.
