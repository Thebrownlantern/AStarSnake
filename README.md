# AStarSnake
If you read the readme file in the master brach you'll see what a lot of this is about. Also, check out the 
notes folder because that's where a lot of the notes and thoughts I had on the subject matter are located.

**NOTE: the drawing part of A star test isn't working. It throws an error because the magnitudes are
high when calculating the gradient. It's really a trial and error with figuring out the factor to make 
each tile go down by and the colors I want to se things to. Excpect major rework on this front because I 
need to get some strong test cases for the gradient. Also as i'm writing this, I realize I should make 
the gradient a file all by itself for cleanliness and readability sake, so expect this in the future also.
